# Krumpac Reforge UI

This mod is a mod for use with [Krumpac Reforge](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Krumpac/Krumpac_Reforge_Core/) mod pack. 
This mod is built with [Azumatt's Minimal_UI](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Azumatt/Minimal_UI/), refer there for more information.

## How do config changes

You can read on config also at Azu's mod page, see link above.

In general his mod allows changes in-game via:
1. Press "F7" key to enable / disable editing.
2. Using a BepInEx config manager mod to be able to change configs in-game, like for example [Azu's inofficial but maybe better config manager](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Azumatt/Azus_UnOfficial_ConfigManager/) or the more default one [Official BepInEx config manager](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/).

Beware that any customizations will be overwritten if we update this mod, since it delivers default configs.
You can either backup your custom settings before updating or doing the changes once again quickly.

### Using F7 to adjust layout

If you choose to use the "F7" hotkey to drag and drop UI elements you can cycle trough the different screen layouts using the "right mouse button":
1. First screen shows your screen without any box open.
2. Second screen shows inventory, opened box and crafting screen.
3. Third screen shows the building screen.

In any of those screens you can:
1. Click & hold with "left mouse button" to drag & drop elements.
2. Press & hold "left control button" to increase / decrease size of the element using your mouse scroll wheel.
3. Press & hold "left shift button" to change rotation of a UI element (be careful, sometimes changing this back requires to go to config manager).

Beware to exit the editing via again pressing "F7" key.

## Compatibility

The UI pack is compatible to all Krumpac mods, but we cannot guarantee compatibility with other mods that might be useful and you might want to also install.
